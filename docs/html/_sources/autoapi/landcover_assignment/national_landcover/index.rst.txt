   National Land Cover Data Analysis
   =================================

   The National Land Cover class is designed to facilitate access and analysis of national land cover data, encompassing various land use types
   such as forests, wetlands, croplands, grasslands, and settlements. This class leverages a data loader to fetch predefined datasets and provides
   a suite of methods to calculate and retrieve detailed information about land cover characteristics, including areas and soil composition shares,
   for different years.

   Features:
   ---------
   - Access to national land cover data for multiple land use types.
   - Calculation of land use areas and shares of different soil compositions.
   - Ability to retrieve data for specific years, enabling temporal analysis.
   - Support for scenario-based analysis with functions to handle spared areas and potential for organic soil use.

   Dependencies:
   -------------
   - ``resource_manager.data_loader.Loader``: For loading national land cover datasets.
   - ``pandas``: For data manipulation and analysis.
