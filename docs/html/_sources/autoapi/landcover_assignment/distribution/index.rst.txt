   Distribution
   ================
   This module is designed to manage and process land distribution scenarios for the Irish national context, particularly focusing on adjustments
   in land use areas based on various scenario inputs. It integrates with land cover data management,
   scenario-specific data fetching, and national area analysis to provide a comprehensive tool for land distribution analysis.

   Features:
   ---------
   - **Land Distribution Analysis**: Manages the calculation and distribution of land areas across different land use types
     based on scenario-driven changes.
   - **Grassland Distribution Management**: Specifically handles the redistribution of grassland areas, taking into account
     changes in mineral and organic components.

   Dependencies:
   -------------
   - ``landcover_assignment.landcover_data_manager.DistributionManager``
   - ``landcover_assignment.national_landcover.NatioanlLandCover``
   - ``resource_manager.scenario_data_fetcher.ScenarioDataFetcher``
   - ``pandas`` for data manipulation and analysis.

   Classes:
   --------
   .. class:: LandDistribution(scenario_data)
      :noindex:

      Handles the distribution of land areas for various land use types under different scenarios, adjusting for changes in
      areas and soil composition.

      .. method:: land_distribution(land_use, new_area)
         Calculates and updates the distribution of land based on land use type and the area change. It supports special
         handling for grassland, wetland, and forest types, among others, adjusting shares of mineral, organic, and other
         soil types accordingly.

      .. method:: grassland_distribution(mineral_area, organic_area, grassland_area)
         Specifically handles the distribution and adjustment of grassland areas, considering changes in mineral and organic
         components, and recalculates the total remaining grassland area along with its composition.

.. py:class:: LandDistribution(scenario_data)


   Handles the distribution of land areas for various land use types under different scenarios,
   adjusting for changes in areas and soil composition.

   This class provides methods to calculate and update land distribution based on changes in land use
   types, including special considerations for grassland, wetland, and forest. It utilizes data from
   land cover data managers, catchment analysis, and scenario-specific data fetchers to accurately
   model land distribution adjustments under various scenarios.

   :param scenario_data: A DataFrame containing scenario-specific data inputs. This data is used to fetch catchment
                         names and drive the scenario-based calculations for land distribution adjustments.
   :type scenario_data: pd.DataFrame

   .. attribute:: data_manager_class

      An instance of DistributionManager for managing land distribution data.

      :type: DistributionManager

   .. attribute:: national_class

      An instance of NatioanlLandCover for accessing and analyzing Irish national context land cover data.

      :type: NationalLandCover

   .. attribute:: sc_fetcher_class

      An instance of ScenarioDataFetcher initialized with scenario data for fetching scenario-specific information.

      :type: ScenarioDataFetcher

   .. method:: land_distribution(land_use, new_area)

      Calculates and updates the distribution of land based on land use type and the area change.
      It supports special handling for grassland, wetland, and forest types, among others, adjusting shares
      of mineral, organic, and other soil types accordingly.


   .. method:: grassland_distribution(mineral_area, organic_area, grassland_area)

      Specifically handles the distribution and adjustment of grassland areas, considering changes in mineral
      and organic components, and recalculates the total remaining grassland area along with its composition.


   .. py:method:: land_distribution(year, land_use, new_area)

      Calculates and updates the land distribution based on land use type and area change.

      :param year: The reference year for national land use data
      :type year: int
      :param land_use: The type of land use to calculate distribution for.
      :type land_use: str
      :param new_area: The area change to be applied to the land use type.
      :type new_area: float
      :return: A dictionary containing updated land distribution details.
      :rtype: dict


   .. py:method:: grassland_distriubtion(year, mineral_area, organic_area, grassland_area)

      Manages the distribution of grassland areas, taking into account changes in mineral and organic areas.

      :param year: The reference year for national land use data
      :type year: int
      :param mineral_area: The area of grassland to be converted to mineral soil.
      :type mineral_area: float
      :param organic_area: The area of grassland to be converted to rewetted organic soil.
      :type organic_area: float
      :param grassland_area: The total initial grassland area before distribution.
      :type grassland_area: pandas.DataFrame
      :return: A dictionary containing updated grassland distribution details.
      :rtype: dict
